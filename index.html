                We understand the importance of finding reliable tenants who
                will treat your property with care and respect. With over a
                decade of experience in the industry, we take pride in our
                expertise in selecting the right tenants for our clients.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here's how our Tenant Selection process works:
                <br />
                <br />
                ⦁ <strong>Initial Viewings and Shortlisting:</strong> We conduct
                viewings with multiple applicants and carefully shortlist the
                best candidates based on various criteria, including their
                rental history, employment status, and suitability for the
                property.
                <br />
                <br />
                ⦁ <strong>Strong References: </strong> Leveraging our extensive
                network built over years of operation in the Otago region, we
                personally know many local landlords, property managers, and
                employers. This enables us to obtain genuine references for
                prospective tenants, providing you with valuable insights into
                their reliability and trustworthiness.
                <br />
                <br />
                ⦁ <strong>Comprehensive Checks: </strong> To further vet
                potential tenants, we conduct rigorous credit and background
                checks. Our credit checks (Equifax and Centrix), assess the
                financial stability of applicants. Additionally, our background
                checks dig into various databases, including the Tenancy
                Tribunal, New Zealand Police, Ministry of Justice, NZ
                Insolvency, and more. These checks help us ensure that
                prospective tenants have a clean record and are suitable
                candidates for your property.
